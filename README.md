RegEx to Minimized Dfa Converter
\
This is a program that handles regular expressions by converting them into a
minimized deterministic finite state machine.
\
There are two pieces to this program: One is a set of tests, which are run
through the JSON file (under the name 'test'). The second part is an interactive
HTML page where you can generate your own DFA by inputing your own regular
expression and seeing how its DFA behaves.
\
A small note: the FIRST time you input something on the html page, sometimes it
reloads for no reason. But this only happens once when you open it up; never more.
